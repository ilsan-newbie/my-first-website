    javaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.<br>
    Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.<br>
    All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.<br>
    JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.<br>
    It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. <br>
    It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. <br>
    It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).<br>
    The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities.<br>
    In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.<br>
    JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications.<br>
    The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.<br>
    Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.<br>
