  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.<br>
  [1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.<br>
  [2]CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.<br>
  [3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics <br>
  ; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content <br>
  ; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting. <br>
  Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, <br>
  in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device. <br>
  [4]The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. <br>
  This cascading priority scheme is predictable. <br>
  The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). <br>
  The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents. <br>
  [5]In addition to HTML, other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.<br><br>
