  <h2>WEB</h2>
  Web is a computer programming system created by Donald E. <br>
  Knuth as the first implementation of what he called "literate programming": <br>
  the idea that one could create software as works of literature, by embedding source code inside descriptive text, <br>
  rather than the reverse (as is common practice in most programming languages), in an order that is convenient for exposition to human readers, <br>
  rather than in the order demanded by the compiler.<br>
  Web consists of two secondary programs: TANGLE, which produces compilable Pascal code from the source texts, and WEAVE, which produces nicely-formatted, printable documentation using TeX.<br>
  CWEB is a version of Web for the C programming language, while noweb is a separate literate programming tool, which is inspired by Web (as reflected in the name) and which is language agnostic.<br>
  The most significant programs written in Web are TeX and Metafont. Modern TeX distributions use another program Web2C to convert Web source to C.<br><br>
