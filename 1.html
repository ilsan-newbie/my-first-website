    <strong><u>HTML</u></strong> The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br>
    It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br>
    Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br>
    HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.<br>
    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page.<br>
    HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.<br>
    HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.Tags such as img / and input / directly introduce content into the page.<br>
    Other tags such as p surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.<br>
    Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.<br>
    HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.<br>
    Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. <br>
    The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.<br>
    [2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the canvas element, in collaboration with javascript.
